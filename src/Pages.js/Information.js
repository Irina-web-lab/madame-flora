<p>Flowers can serve as an addition to a gift or be the main present itself, such as a huge bouquet of roses or a chic multi-component composition. But in any case, it must be fresh. After all, hardly anyone will be pleased with a bouquet of wilted flowers.
When buying a bouquet in a flower shop, you are sure of its freshness, now the main thing is to keep it fresh not only until the moment of giving, but also after, so that it pleases with its beauty for as long as possible.</p>

<h3>To do this, just follow a few simple tips:</h3>

<p>1. Flowers painfully endure any transportation, especially if transportation. Therefore, try to keep the bouquet in water all the time until you bring it home and put it in a vase. Ask the florist who assembled your bouquet to wrap the stems of the bouquet with damp paper or cloth. Or place in a shipping bag with water.</p>

<p>2. Floristic shops store flowers in specialized refrigerators, where the optimum temperature for flowers is maintained from +5 to +7 degrees Celsius. Sudden changes in temperature can adversely affect the freshness of flowers, so try not to immediately transfer the bouquet to a room with central heating. Keep it for a while in a cooler place. Also, do not forget that in winter, when transporting a bouquet along the street, it should be wrapped, because. freezing temperatures will destroy delicate flowers.</p>

<p>3. Before you put the flowers in a vase with water (the water should be cool), you need to cut all the stems of the bouquet. The cut is made with a sharp knife obliquely.</p>

<p>4. Make sure that leaves or flower shoots do not fall into the water. The florist who picked the bouquet has probably already removed them, but if they are still present, remove them. This is necessary to avoid water pollution, as well as to prolong the life of the flower. After all, all shoots and leaves will take some of the water from the main stem, thereby weakening it and reducing its lifespan.</p>

<p>5. Do not forget to change the water in the vase daily and freshen the cut stems. Clean water in a vase is very important! Stagnant or dead water shortens the life of even very resistant flowers.</p>

<p>All these actions will not take you much time, five minutes a day is enough and the bouquet will delight you with its freshness and beauty for as long as possible!
